# Accelerate your delivery with CircleCI orbs

CircleCI already helps make your applications scalable, reliable, and secure. With complex pipelines, though, you could be duplicating effort and code. By using _orbs_, you can simplify CI/CD across multiple projects with similar needs.

Orbs are shareable and customizable packages of CircleCI configuration for streamlining your builds. You can condense complex commands, executors, and jobs into single, reusable lines of code. Orbs ensure your pipeline remains both reliable and efficient at scale. And with common code, you only need to update it in one place. You'll save time, increase efficiency, and boost readability.

## How do you find orbs?

Through the [CircleCI Orb Registry](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs), you'll find thousands of easy-to-implement third-party integrations, including Slack, AWS, and Kubernetes. Orbs include descriptions and use cases, helping you quickly implement them in your own project. You can access a wealth of additional features, with no extra work.

All orbs in the registry are open source and published through an MIT License. Many are available through GitHub, too, allowing you to extend the orb's functionality and share your contribution with other developers.

There are three types of orb in the Registry:

- **Certified orbs:** written, maintained, and tested by the CircleCI team.
- **Partner orbs:** created by technology partners.
- **Community orbs:** contributed by community members. 

You can search by name, category, or type to find a solution.

## What can you do with orbs?

With the popular Slack certified orb, it's easy to create custom notifications for any job. You can set parameters, including the message text, users to @ mention, and even the color of the message box. Prefer Jira? The Jira orb automatically reports the status of builds and deployments to your Jira Cloud instance.
	
Import the AWS S3, Azure, and Google Cloud orbs to configure an upload without installing the CLI or creating a config file. Using Heroku? Install the Heroku orb to quickly build, test, and deploy your applications with a few lines of code. As orbs are completely customizable and parameterized, you can reduce build time without comprising on your specific requirements.

## How can you create your own orbs?

If you can't find what you need in the Registry, create your own orbs with the [Orb Development Kit](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-author/#orb-development-kit). We'll guide you through the process and provide a template to get you started. On a CircleCI paid plan, you can create private orbs for use within your  team. They don't appear in the Registry and can't be used by anyone outside your organization. Alternatively, share your orb publicly through the Registry.

With orbs, developers focus on designing workflows, rather than duplicating effort. Accelerate your development and delivery with simple, reusable, maintainable code. To get started, browse the [CircleCI Orb Registry](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs), or create your own with the [Orb Development Kit](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-author/#orb-development-kit). See how much time you could save.
